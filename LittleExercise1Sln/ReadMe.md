# Little exercise
You are given two numbers (max 32 bits), N and M and two bit positions, i and j. You need to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i where the gap between i and j will be enough to fit M into N.

## Example:
If N = 10000000000 and M = 10011, i=2 and j=6 then the result will be 1000(10011)00.

## You need to write a method that will
1. Cover all corner cases.
2. Use any of your preferred language
	a. But no library usage.
	b. Unit test methods (preferred unit test).
